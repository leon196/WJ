# amd-three.js 

amd-three.js is an example of how to structure an [three.js](http://threejs.org/) application, with functionality split into different [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/) modules.

It is meant as a starting point for more involved projects involving three.js, where having all the code in one file can quickly get unwieldy.

It is also useful for prototyping, as a lot of the boilerplate is moved out of your way.
